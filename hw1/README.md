This is the code I used to address P4 and P5. and I've annotated the code.

For P4, I needed to understand the method to calculate Euclidean distance. 
I referred to the following article for conceptual understanding on calculating distances using numpy.
For how to calculate Euclidean distance in Python, see this URL.

For P5, to beautifully render the scatter plot, I referred to the article below.
